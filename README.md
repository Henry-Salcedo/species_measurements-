# species_measurements-
Combining the measurements of 3 different irise's species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica), to see similarities/differences among them using pandas to generate the dataframe. 

Summary: When it comes to similarities the versicolor and virginica species have positive corrorlation within there mean, median, and even standard deviation. However setosa shares almost consistant diffrences with the other species.  


## a) Purpose of the Program(s):

    The purpose of this program was to combine measurements of the 3 species into a dataframe, generate correlation, mean. median, standard deviations and then determine how similar/diffrnece the species are with one another's measurements.
    
    The following modules that were used for the project only consisted of:
    pandas (Main focus in the project)
    math
    numpy
    
## b) Input:

    The program takes the following inputs:
        Two '.csv' file that contained petal and sepal measurements of the species.
        
        
## c) Expected Output:

    Generate dataframe using pandas (that contains sample id, species, petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width), then calculating corrorlation, mean, median, and standard deviation.
    
## d) Type of Execution:

       Sequential Execution: The code is executed in a linear order from top to bottom.

    The program:
    Combine into dataframe
    Calculate corrorlation
    Find mean, and median
    Calculate standard deviation

## e) Possible Improvements:

    The program could be improved by:
    1. Generate some charts to help see corrorlations/similarties from calculations (perhaps a scatter plot)
    2. Could have done a quality check for any missing values, duplicates, etc.
    3. Additionlly could confirm the merges intergrity.
    4. Have made the corrorlation calculation more readable and instead made to show the 6 diffrent compairisons rather than what I did (placing lables as to which species were being compaired within each).
