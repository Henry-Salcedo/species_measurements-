# species_measurements-
Combining the measurements of 3 different irise's, to see similarities/differences among them using pandas to generate the dataframe.


## a) Purpose of the Program(s):

    The purpose of this program was to combine measurements of the 3 species into a dataframe, generate correlation, mean. median, standard deviations and then determine how similar/diffrnece the species are with one another's measurements.
    
    The following modules that were used for the project only consisted of:
    Random
    Time
    String
    numpy (Main focus in the project)
    Pandas

## b) Input:

    The program takes the following inputs:
        Two '.csv' file that contained petal and sepal measurements of the species.
        
  
        
## c) Expected Output:

    @The expected output was calculating each of the prompts, and then returning them listed of 100 players right after.
    Outputs came back as expected with minor hickups reguarding some variable placements.
    
## d) Type of Execution:

       @ Sequential Execution: The code is executed in a linear order from top to bottom.

    The program:@
    Calculated field goal accuracy, three point accuracy, and free throw accuracy.
    Other calculations after done in sequancal order as I have mention at the start with there lists following them within the same funtion.
    Last, was the first 3 calculations reciving there list like the others prior.

## e) Possible Improvements:

    The program could be improved by:@
    1. The orginization of the codes and when it was excecuted could have be more clean.
    2. Made calculation and listing more casual/direct.
    3. Do more research reguarding basketball to understand the true value of the calculations done.
