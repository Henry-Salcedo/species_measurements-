# species_measurements-
Combining the measurements of 3 different irise's, to see similarities/differences among them using pandas to generate the dataframe.


## a) Purpose of the Program(s):

    The purpose of this program was to combine measurements of the 3 species into a dataframe, generate correlation, mean. median, standard deviations and then determine how similar/diffrnece the species are with one another's measurements.
    
    The following modules that were used for the project only consisted of:
    Random
    Time
    String
    numpy (Main focus in the project)
    Pandas

## b) Input:

    The program takes the following inputs:
        Two '.csv' file that contained petal and sepal measurements of the species.
        
        
## c) Expected Output:

    Generate dataframe using pandas, calculating corrorlation, mean, median, and standard deviation.
    
## d) Type of Execution:

       Sequential Execution: The code is executed in a linear order from top to bottom.

    The program:@
    Combine into dataframe
    Calculate corrorlation
    Find mean, and median
    Calculate standard deviation

## e) Possible Improvements:

    The program could be improved by:
    1. 
    2. 
    3.
